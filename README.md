A Dart Tiled library.

## Install from Dart Pub Repository

Include the following in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
    dependencies:
      tiled: 0.6.0
```

## Usage

Import the package like this:

```dart
    import 'package:tiled/tiled.dart'
```

Load a TMX file into a string by any means, and then pass the string to an instance of TileMapParser.parse:

```dart
    final String tmxBody = /* ... */;
    final TileMapParser parser = TileMapParser();
    final TileMap map = parser.parse(tmxBody);
```

## Credits

TMX support is work of @radicaled and we have got his code from [tmx.dart](https://github.com/radicaled/tmx.dart) lib.
